# Day 13

Sunday = day off. Played with the correlations a bit and wrote up yesterday's post, and then did my standard weekly review.

Reflecting on the Kevin Kelly advice, which was partially a trigger for this aliveline:
>Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.

Another KK bit of advice that was a trigger for this as well (paraphrased):
>Steady production teaches you a spirit of abundance, which lets you let go of good work to reach the great stuff.
