# Day 16

Energy was not right, didn't do anything today and just went to go see the sunrise instead

Part of me wants to just stop this here, holidays are coming up and it would be nice to not have pressure to work on stuff + space to reflect on the year etc. I'm considering it. Let's see how I feel tomorrow.
