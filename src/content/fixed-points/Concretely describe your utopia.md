In other words, [[Focus on what you want to see more of]] and describe it in detail a la [[Planning is priceless, plans are worthless]]. This process can help mold your attention towards bringing it about.


My utopia as of 10/5/2025:

>I wake up early, take a short walk outside, make some espresso, and drink it while journaling, enjoying some peaceful solitude. I work on a creative project by myself for ~2 hours.
>My wife and son have probably woken up by then, so I say I love you to them both and do silly faces and accents with my son as I feed and change him. We eat some breakfast and head outside for a walk in a park with our friend(s) who live close by.
>We catch up and chat through the latest on the ambitious project we're working on together, loosely brainstorming ideas and having fun doing it. We head to a cafe to continue working and grab some lunch once we're done. A bit after lunch we head to the court to play some tennis.
>Head home to continue working with friends, taking short breaks to mess around with my son and feed/change him. We either have some friends over for dinner or walk to a restaurant nearby, and have a nice evening stroll afterwards, ideally catching the sunset.
>We wind down, giving my son a bath, playing with him some more, and chatting with my wife about how the day went. Read for 20-30 minutes and call it a night.
>One night a week might be a board game night with friends, attending a class a friend is teaching, going out to karaoke. On weekends we might go on long walk-and-talks or hikes together.
