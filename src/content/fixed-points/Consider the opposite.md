This is a tool to help [[Counteract confirmation bias]].

When using writing as a tool to think and learn about a topic, explicitly taking the opposite view & finding the best arguments for it is very useful. This is also known as steel-manning. Iteratively steel-manning a view can teach you a lot.

It is much easier to do this when you [[Take a stand]] on the topic by articulating a strong positive claim. You then have a view you can react to & explicitly oppose.
