Because [[Confirmation bias is the one to watch for]], it is especially useful to think through ways to counteract it or even turn it to your advantage.

Counteracting it:
- [[Consider the opposite]]
- [[Treat answers as tools]]

Turning it to your advantage:
- [[Focus on what you want to see more of]]
- [[Concretely describe your utopia]]
- [[What I want to see in the world]]
- [[Design your environment as scaffolding towards creating the world you want to see]]
