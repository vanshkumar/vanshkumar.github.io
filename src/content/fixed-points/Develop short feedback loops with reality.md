This is the best way to learn and grow.

**Short:**
- Be prolific, take a lot of shots on goal
- Get feedback quickly (trusted testers, audience size)

**Feedback:**
- Encourage honesty (anonymize)
- Accept feedback non-judgmentally and from a place of truly wanting to improve

**Loop:**
- Run experiments _repeatedly_
- Reflect on and incorporate feedback from previous iterations

**Reality:**
- Avoid overly abstracting, keep things concrete
