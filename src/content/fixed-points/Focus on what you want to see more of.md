Spend your energy on how you want the world to be, not criticizing how you don’t want it to be.

[[Concretely describe your utopia]] and focus on bringing about the parts of it.

Spend your energy on how you want the world to be, not criticizing how you don't want it to be.

What you resist, persists. Resisting something is focusing on it -> it amplifies.

I don't want to hear your predictions for the future, I want to hear what you want the future to look like.

What are some examples? When in my life or friends' lives did we focus on what we want to see more of?
- In college I was mildly depressed when I spent a lot of my time focusing on other people's mental health issues
- 

What do I mean by "how you want the world to be"? What do I mean by "criticizing how you don't want it to be?"
- This is more of a felt sense rather than a prescription for what to say/do. You can tell when you're in one mode vs the other.
- Is this creator/editor mode? No not really. An ideal editor understands the author's vision for how they want the world (piece to be) and helps shape the piece towards that. It's more like loving feedback than criticism. Again the difference is in attitude / it's a felt sense.

> I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.

-Nietzsche
