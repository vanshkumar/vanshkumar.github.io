A high quality education requires two factors:
## A positive context
A social environment & positive cultural context that prizes educational values such as growth, curiosity, learning, wonder.

This is because [[Humans preferentially learn from those we consider high status]] and specifically [[Children use age as a proxy for status]]. If children have slightly older role model that embody educational values, they will imitate and learn from them.

Because [[Public schools don't enforce a specific educational culture]], they may or may not be able to provide this positive context.


See [[Techniques to scale an opinionated educational culture]] for ways to build this

## Personalization
A teacher/mentor/guide that champions the culture while paying an insane amount of attention to each child, personalizing their education & overall development as a human being.

Such a teacher will make sure to [[Design your environment as scaffolding towards creating the world you want to see]]
