These techniques are used by Jesuit & Montessori schools to maintain and scale an extremely opinionated educational culture (though perhaps at the cost of less adaptability over time):

- Age-mixing: so kids have older peers they can imitate
- Status manipulation: elevating the status of kids that demonstrate desired cultural norms
- Lineage traditions: teachers are taught through apprenticeship & are 'true believers' in the educational movement
- Opt-in membership: a culture is limited on how many new participants it can absorb per year without losing its coherence
