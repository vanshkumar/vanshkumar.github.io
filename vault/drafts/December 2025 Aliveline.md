# What is an "Aliveline"?
Early December 2025 I was feeling a bit lost. Or more specifically, I was feeling low on *momentum*. I recalled enjoying reading about [month-to-master](https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch/m2m-day-1-completing-12-ridiculously-hard-challenges-in-12-months-9843700c741f) projects where someone takes on a seemingly insane challenge, like trying to become a chess grandmaster in a month. They often don't succeed, but do sometimes fail in an interesting way as constraints can breed creativity. I decided to do one of these in December 2025, and chose the term "aliveline" in lieu of deadline – the point of these constraints is to excite you about a crazy sounding goal and ultimately to make you feel more alive.

I also believe that [[Ambitious goals are valuable to direct present activity, not as final ends in themselves]], and starting an aliveline was a way to directly test that.

So for December I chose to try to **have and publish an original insight**. I began the aliveline on December 2 and was intending to give myself until January 2, but life intervened and I wrapped it up on January 31.

A more detailed definition, from [[2025-12-02-december-aliveline-1]]
>What I mean by "have and publish an original insight":
> - I have been reading here and there about intelligence – how we learn, how the brain works, how ML works, etc
> - I want to publish something that is original relative to the current research AND more importantly something that I would consider novel/interesting today

I had zero neuroscience background going into this, but wanted to jump start progress on one of my two main quests – the question of **how do we learn?**

# Did I succeed?
No.

I ended with a concrete [experiment](https://github.com/vanshkumar/LOOPER-freely-moving-worms) extending a method to recover low-D loops representing locomotion in *C. Elegans* brains, to freely moving worms (the original paper had found clean loops in immobilized worms). I was unable to recover clean loops in most of the worm neural traces I tested, except for a couple of them. The research literature agrees – others have also found it difficult to find clean locomotion loops in freely moving worms, because there is just so much going on in their brains.

My result was not original relative to the current research. It is something that I would have considered novel/interesting at the beginning of December, though, so perhaps I can give myself partial credit.
