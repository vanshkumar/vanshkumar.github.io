# Day 7

It's been a week since I started this aliveline. And I feel like I've done nothing! Amazing. This timeline is so insanely compressed - I am starting to feel a bit of pressure which is kind of against the point of this. Have to keep reminding myself that failure is expected & the goal is to try to fail in interesting ways. How can I fail more interestingly? What are super weird out of the box creative ways to approach this insane goal I've set?

The way a particular brain represents something is in a unique coordinate system, though it is likely related to how other brains choose to represent the same thing via some kind of linear transformation. So if you're given a particular brain's neural population activations.. can you reconstruct what the person is seeing/thinking/whatever? If you have some alphabet of neural population manifolds, I suppose you could compare against those, up to a linear transformation (rotation, translation)? Is there a "hash" you could take that preserves what matters so you can quickly compare against some library of manifolds? Shazam-ing a brain.

There is explicitly [work](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46814) ([older preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08533)) that shows the above more or less for *C. Elegans*. Different worms conserve the same low dimensional manifold for motor activity, despite individual neuron activations being distinct. They call it "macroscopic universality, microscopic degeneracy" and they make a lot of analogies to statistical physics. Universality classes are definitely relevant here.
