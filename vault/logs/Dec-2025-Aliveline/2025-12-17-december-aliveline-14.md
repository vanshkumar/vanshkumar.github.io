# Day 14

What do I hypothesize/believe about the *C. Elegans* brain **right now**?
- Each individual's brain has its own coordinate system to implement the same behaviors
	- "Macroscopic universality, microscopic degeneracy"
- There exists a locomotion population subspace; projecting each worm brain into its locomotion subspace & associated manifold allows us to predict locomotion
	- Why do I think this?
		- It feels that there has to be some universal coordinate system across worms when they are developmentally identical – all of them move and it doesn't feel likely that all of their brains independently happen to discover movement
		- Natural selection works at the level of behavior, so it makes sense that there would be *some* way to universally compare key behavior like locomotion across worms
	- What would alternative explanations of the above look like?
		- 
- The locomotion manifold has a conserved shape across worms at the start of their life (it is somehow developmentally canalized), but it changes as the worm learns & based on the context/task
	- How does the manifold change?
- In freely moving worms in their natural contexts, the locomotion subspace/manifold is just one of possibly many subspaces/manifolds present as the worm is doing many things, and they interact
	- How do they interact?

The brain is tiny (302 neurons). As per the Liang paper it has 1-4 neurons per cell type, so little to no neuron redundancy. How might it do error correction / avoid catastrophic forgetting?
- Their proposal is "context-gating", ie encode something about the context+stimulus combo rather than changing the global neuronal response for a stimulus
	- I think all brains obviously do this?
