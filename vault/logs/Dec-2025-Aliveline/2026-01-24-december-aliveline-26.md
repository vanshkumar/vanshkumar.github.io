# Day 26

More progress on extending LOOPER to freely moving worms & heat pulse (Atanas data). Sent an [[Email to Connor Brennan]] and had some correspondence regarding LOOPER theoretically and also asked him about a strange detrending line in the OSF LOOPER code.

Just 5ish days left in this aliveline. What can I realistically end up with, and post, here?
- Results of LOOPER on Atanas data
- A lot of conceptual questions/thoughts
	- These can be converted to an "evergreen questions" format
- The 31 days of working notes
  
- Reflections on the aliveline itself/the process
