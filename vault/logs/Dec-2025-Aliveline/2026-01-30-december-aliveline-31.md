# Day 31

Last day!

I don't think my original recovery dynamics after heat pulse question was very well-formed. Eg see [this chat](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-697c0c8c08588191a0e43a581a338494-looper-code-correctness/c/697c5053-ddb8-832c-916d-59f3ed78485f). Should have a spent a lot more time iterating on & dissecting that. Oh well! [Repo](https://github.com/vanshkumar/LOOPER-freely-moving-worms) is reflective of where I currently am.

Also converted my various questions/thoughts into Evergreen style notes. Super bare bones so far but it's fine, some kind of linkage is captured.

Wrote down some reflections on this whole process, will write more today & review them in a week or so when I do the overall writeup.

I'll email Connor Brennan to get his thoughts on my overall hypothesis/approach here... ChatGPT has given me some ideas but this is a good point to chat with him as I have a clear hypothesis question.

Sent an email, see [[Email to Connor Brennan]] followup section. This was an extremely useful exercise in thinking through wtf I'm actually doing. I need to do more of this more often.

Is the ultimate result of this month of work... a single email? Ha.
