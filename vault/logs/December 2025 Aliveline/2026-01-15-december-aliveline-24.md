# Day 24

Let's get into the experiment.

I don't think the original ChatGPT experiment suggestion makes sense. It's overindexing on the speculation in the Moore paper that a network of switching linear DD-DCs could work IMO. I highly doubt a naive piecewise linear model of neuronal activity can work (though it would obviously be better than a single global model). Iterating on this...

Yea I don't think the qsimeon dataset can show anything particularly interesting for my overall hypothesis, which is now:
> Genes work at the neuron level, but need to encode behavior (eg locomotion) as a top-down computational constraint on the network. They accomplish this via modifying neurons' nonlinear feedback control algorithms. This results in certain structures (eg 2D loops for locomotion in C Elegans) appearing with very high probability, despite each overall brain's neural coordinate system being unique.
