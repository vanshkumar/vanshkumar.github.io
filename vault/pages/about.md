This site is a living workspace for Vansh Kumar's experiments, writing, and shared notes. Inspired heavily by the concept of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), it evolves as the graph fills in.

The [terrain](/terrain) page is where all the good stuff lives. The terminology is inspired by dynamical systems and the content is organized into:
- **Attractors** – larger projects/essays
- **Probes** – guiding questions
- **Traces** – atomic building blocks for attractors/probes (not indexed)
