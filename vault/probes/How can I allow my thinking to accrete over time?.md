I am a big fan of the concept of [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX) from Andy Matuschak. I very much believe in [[Build systems to revisit ideas]] over time – the unit of knowledge work should be non-transient, accrete over time, actively sharpen your thinking, and allow connections between ideas to emerge organically.

However, every time I have tried to write notes in this format, it has felt like an uphill battle. I end up with some notes but it feels like I am forcing myself to write them.

For now, I am trying out organizing my thinking primarily in the form of Evergreen *questions* (called **probes**), with standard Evergreen notes (called **traces**) as the building blocks for these longer question-notes. Probes are still intended to be (relatively) atomic, concept-oriented, and densely linked, as the original Evergreen notes prescribes.

I find questions more interesting than answers, and suspect this format will help me [[Treat answers as tools]]. But at the same time I want to avoid having a ton of vague untestable questions, because [[Ideas are not knowledge until they are tested or experienced]]. I don't yet know the best way to accomplish this, but I am trying out ensuring that all probes have a short footer with "reality contact" describing how to test the question, which might be:
- a conversation to seek counterexamples
- a reading target (“find a case where this fails”)
- an experiment to run

The inspiration for the above is loosely the scientific method, and writing in such a style is intended to sharpen my question-asking skills. Let's see how it goes.
