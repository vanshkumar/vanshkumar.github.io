Montessori prepared environment:
- Curated toys/educational items
- Each item gives the child immediate feedback if they're accomplishing the goal correctly etc
- Teachers don't step in to help kids, they figure it out on their own
- Feels somewhat.. entitled? Not really subversive

Hacker mindset:
- Everything is malleable/hackable
- There is no "correct" way to do things, there is only what you can and can't change
- Subversive

Both encourage independence & figuring things out on their own. A hacker mindset approach wouldn't have pre-prepped the environment so that it's natural for kids to do things as intended I would think..? Because there is an assumption there is not a correct way to do things in the first place.
