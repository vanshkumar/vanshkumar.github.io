Life, growth, and education are all continuous processes with no end. A particular end (goal) is useful as it affects how you order your present activity (means) towards it.  Once an end or goal is reached, it becomes yet another means towards your next end/goal, as a continuous process does not have a rigid fixed end point.

Need a pithier way of formulating exactly what I'm trying to say... some ideas:
- Goals are useful directionally rather than as rigid fixed points
- Ends become means when they are reached
- Means are ends and ends are means in a continuous process
-
