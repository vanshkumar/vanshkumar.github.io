To do really excellent work, you need to:
1. Have patience – it can take time for ideas to marinate and your brain to make connections
2. [[Build systems to revisit ideas]]
3. [[Develop short feedback loops with reality]] for your ideas to accelerate the process – collaboration, posting publicly, etc
4. Metacognition – constantly identifying bottlenecks & speeding up the process itself
