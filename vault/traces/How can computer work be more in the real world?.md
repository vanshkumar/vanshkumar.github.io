It's frustrating to do computer work and not be able to model doing something productive for Rami. If I was building something with my hands he could watch me do it; right now he just sees "dad is on the computer" which could mean anything. How to resolve this?
	It's easier when he's older and you can explain what you're doing maybe?

A simpler case of this is when I'm reading on a Kindle vs a physical book. Even that is unclear for him.

Want to avoid Ekansh situation where I did all my schoolwork separate from time w him; mostly what we did together was pinge soccer random games etc

All of this points towards how do we make computing – thinking – more tactile, more human, more immersive, more *in the real world* rather than its own separate world?


How can *thinking* be more in the real world? Right now:
- Communication requires language and writing
- So the best we can do is writing/talking

Two approaches suggest themselves:
- Get better at explicitly communicating your own thinking processes (worthwhile for your own edification)
- Obviate the need for commmunication
	- No writing/talking (brain<>brain communication in language)
	- No language (brain<>brain communication in ... electricity? chemicals?)
