>It might be the case that the only way to grow cultures deliberately is by trending toward dogmatism. But I do think there it is possible — with new technology, perhaps increasingly so — to navigate this tension productively. It is possible to instill invaluable ideals. We may struggle to accomplish this equitably, at least in the short term. But if we fail to do so, I suspect that the gap between those who have access to highly functional cultures and those who do not will only grow more pronounced.
