Humans are social animals and part of that is that we like to outsource cognition as much as we can to our group/society/whatever. This cognitive laziness is key in some sense because it provides an impetus to build cognitive tech to help us think better (?)

However clearly the best ideas are generated when ppl first think on their own and THEN come together to collaborate

Hence why small groups are the best for building new things and thinking new thoughts?

Is the right comparison point a *group* of brains vs a machine? Do humans have meaningful distributed social cognition? How would you measure that

This line of thinking also aligns with my beliefs in scenius vs ‘great man’ of history theory. Very similar to the Kevin Kelly 'technium' ideas as well.
