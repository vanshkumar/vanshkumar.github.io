This is known as the overdetermination / over-justification / undermining effect

So.. [[Why do Alpha School rewards not undermine intrinsic motivation?]]


As performance/mastery-based extrinsic rewards, especially when given for exceeding others, are the least-bad kind of extrinsic reward, the undermining effect may be less relevant for very intelligent/top of the class kids. For those kids, getting great grades is taken as a signal of achievement/mastery, which can help foster intrinsic motivation.
