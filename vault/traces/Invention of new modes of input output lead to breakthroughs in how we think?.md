There was that Andy Matuschak podcast where he notes that new modes of input/output often precede personal computing breakthroughs. Examples he cites:
- Mouse unlocked desktop GUI
- Trackpad enabled mainstream laptops
- Touchscreen sparked mobile revolution
- Haptics give us screenless turn by turn directions
- e-Ink screens give us digital books on the beach
- Commoditized projects make Dynamicland possible
