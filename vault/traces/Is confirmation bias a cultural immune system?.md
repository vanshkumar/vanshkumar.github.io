[[Confirmation bias is the one to watch for]] as it appears to be a core part of human cognition. At a more abstract cultural level, can you think of confirmation bias / belief consistent information processing like a culture's immune system? It prevents individual members from getting sucked into other beliefs and helps ensure the shared beliefs of a culture spread generation to generation. And shared beliefs are presumably necessary for cultural / societal level cooperation and hence a lot of human advancement.

I have a sneaking suspicion that most biases at the individual level may be useful at the collective intelligence level. But perhaps that's overly optimistic.


Can anti-rational memes be explained thru belief consistent information processing?

>Keeping the society static is not, however, the purpose to which any individual static-society meme is adapted. Its purpose is to replicate itself, i.e. to cause behaviour towards children of precisely such a kind as to make them, in due course, behave in the same way towards _their_ children (or pupils, etc.). Therefore the loss of creativity suffered by the recipient of such behaviour cannot be indiscriminate. On the contrary, it must take the form of a finely tuned psychological disorder: the inability not to re-enact the behaviour that caused it.

>Considered as an idea in people’s minds, an anti-rational meme tends to be a false idea, and needs to harm its holders in order to replicate itself.

HMMMMM. it's also possible anti-rational just tend to be ideas that are less easily testable / more cultural and vague, and therefore more susceptible to confirmation bias. the examples of an anti-rational meme are things like parenting & religion, which are not easily testable, whereas the example of a rational meme is newtonian mechanics – easily testable.
