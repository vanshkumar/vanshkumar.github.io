Hmm.. I think this is contingent on having very individualized learning paths, actually. Knowledge-based grades where classes have a mix of ages but everyone is at ~the same knowledge may be worse? Kids who are older but at the same knowledge as a much younger kid may feel much worse about themselves; I suppose this is what age-based grades prevents.

Age-based grades mean that there is a huge incentive to push kids to the next grade regardless of their knowledge of the material – it is social death for a kid if they get 'held back' in a particular grade.

So ideally.. each kid is learning at their own pace & the concept of having to group kids into a class doesn't really exist

I assume academics-based social dynamics still exist at places that do this (eg Alpha School).. what do they look like? I suspect there is still pressure to not 'fall behind' in terms of your "knowledge grade" relative to your same-age peers?
