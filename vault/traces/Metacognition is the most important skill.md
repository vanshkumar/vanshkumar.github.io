Metacognition is the ability to step outside of your thinking process to observe, reflect, question, and improve it.

You can be good at metacognition in one domain (eg academic learning) but not in another (eg relationships).

It's harder to perform metacognition as the difficulty of the task increases. This is why it is important to reflect separately.

The main purpose of a therapist/coach/teacher/whatever is doing metacognition for you

Explicit metacognitive practices:
- Weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual reviews
- Setting aside time to define an ambitious vision
