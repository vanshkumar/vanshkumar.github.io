Nurture Assumption..


The behavioral genetics literature (twin studies) is fairly conclusive on the point that parents have minimal impact on their kid’s long-term personality traits, including eg conscientiousness[2](https://vanshkumar.substack.com/p/some-possibly-controversial-opinions#footnote-2-158732861). Genetics explains roughly half of the variation and environment explains the other half. Peer group and culture [are the parts of the environment that likely have the most impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption).




If you accept that parenting has minimal impact on long-term personality traits, arguments like “you need to do X thing that you really hate because it will teach you to be disciplined in the future” don’t make much sense. Perhaps doing X thing is still valuable _in the moment_ for some unrelated reason (you should clean up after yourself because having a clean room is valuable), but justifying coercing children to do that thing to try to mold their future personality in a specific way is not appropriate. (invest coercion)
