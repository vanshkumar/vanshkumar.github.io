Highly individualized education that truly ensures mastery of the material is significantly more efficient than standard public school education which must go at the pace of the slowest learner in the class


Public school is a suboptimal way to teach children. It teaches to the average across many dimensions, class sizes are large, individualized instruction is rare, and intrinsic motivation for school/learning drops markedly from kindergarten to adolescence[1](https://vanshkumar.substack.com/p/some-possibly-controversial-opinions#footnote-1-158732861). Highly motivated individuals/teachers can do better.
