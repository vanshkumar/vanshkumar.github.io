Play and work are both intelligent ways of approaching something, because they are about reorganizing current behavior to achieve continuity towards a particular future state. In other words, you change what you're doing now to get to a specific future state.

Importantly, the specific future state is not a fixed end point. Once achieved it becomes another intermediate state in the continuous process of growth and education. [[Ambitious goals are valuable to direct present activity, not as final ends in themselves]].

The main difference is in how concerned you are with specific results, rather than attitude. In play, the only goal is to keep the game going. In work, you care more about specific results along the way.
