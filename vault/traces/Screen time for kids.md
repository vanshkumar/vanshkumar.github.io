Screens are a tool at the end of the day so it’s about establishing a good relationship with them. For example we use screens all the time and they’re key to our lives in a lot of ways, and we have mixed relationships with them over time. But ultimately understanding and being able to play with that relationship w screens is the goal
- YouTube is honestly the goat teacher

Positive examples of screen use imo:
- The giving kids unlimited access to screens but only on a local network w curated media, Anki, Ubuntu cli etc
- a phone where the only apps are calling, messaging, FaceTime - messaging especially can help kids write
- Apps like ixl synthesis khanacademy mathacademy physicsgraph beast academy arima mentava etc
- if you go on YouTube you have to be explicitly searching for the video/topic, no algorithm scrolling
- Minecraft or similar open world define your own objective games
- Cities skylines esque shiet (strategy games)
- Rocket league is fine, but they should at least spend some time thinking actively about how to get better about the meta etc
