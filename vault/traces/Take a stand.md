Make positive claims. [[Develop short feedback loops with reality]], and within that [[Treat answers as tools]].

It is easy to criticize something, but harder to suggest an alternative. "Maybe this" is more generative than "not that".

When learning, conversing, doing creative work in a group, or just going about life, taking a stand on a topic is very useful. It gives others something to react to.

Of course this must be coupled with a willingness to be wrong and change your views, ideally even an active desire to be wrong. Holding strong views without believing the original question is settled.

[[Consider the opposite]] is a useful technique that flexes both of the above muscles.
