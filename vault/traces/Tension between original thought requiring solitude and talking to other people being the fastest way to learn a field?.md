Is there a tension between "original thought requires solitude" and "talking to other people is the fastest way to learn a field"?

Probably not. Original thought requires solitude = a state of mind where you are able to cultivate new ideas. You can have that same state of mind while chatting with others to learn a field. They're not directly in tension, it's more that they are orthogonal.
