>My best results have come from odd takes on ideas around me— more like rotations of point of view than incremental progress

From [[The Power of the Context]]

This implies two things:
1. [[Appreciate great ideas from all domains]] & cultivate diversity of input, so you have a rich bank to draw 'odd takes' from
2. Have cool interesting ideas around you to rotate

(1) 

(2) is kind of like [[Design your environment as scaffolding towards creating the world you want to see]]

Internet makes both of these much easier nowadays
