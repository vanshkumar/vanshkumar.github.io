An open attentional approach to questions is akin to an unhurried curiosity. It means not rushing to find _the_ answer to an interesting question; counteracting the default mode where [[People are extremely ready to generate beliefs about the world]].

Answers (perhaps hypotheses is a better word) are still important, but they are more like **tools**. They allow you to [[Take a stand]] so you have a concrete line of thought to follow and test, but it is a mistake to treat them as rigid final products.

Leaving the original question unsettled and making sure you [[Build systems to revisit ideas]] allows the question to continue to be generative over time.
