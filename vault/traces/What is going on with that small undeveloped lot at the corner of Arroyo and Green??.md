I should just ask the city to make it into a park. How do I do that? Parks & rec committee meeting?
	Or can I somehow convince the current owner to sell it to the city for less? Does the current owner live in Pasadena? I assume not... but they are also paying quite a bit of upkeep for a vacant lot.

It should be a park or an apartment complex!! Who owns this land? Public Storage? Is it a prop 13 situation, what are their property taxes? How can they afford to let such prime land just sit there?? So close to the metro & freeway..

property tax rate is $31,979/$2,884,380 = **1.109%**

how much is commercial property tax rate normally?

Seems like in 2021 there was a "Non-reappraisable Trust Transfer". So base year assessments are still based on 2014. Before that base year was 1994. Can see it in [assessment history](https://portal.assessor.lacounty.gov/parceldetail/5722011017) here:

Big jump in assessed value when it was sold in 2014.

So current assessed value per prop 13 should be 2014 value = 2.4M * 1.02^10 = 2.93M, which is roughly correct yea. why is property tax rate > 1% of assessed value tho? I guess some local taxes?

prop 13:
- Tax assessment cap: Prop 13 limits property tax increases to no more than 2% annually, regardless of how much the actual market value of the property increases.
- Reassessment only upon change of ownership: Commercial properties are only reassessed at current market value when they're sold or undergo new construction. This means long-held commercial properties often have assessed values far below their market values.
- Base year value: The property's assessed value is based on its 1975-1976 market value, plus the maximum 2% annual increase since purchase.
- Tax rate: The property tax rate is capped at 1% of the assessed value.
