First, is the premise even accurate? Do Alpha graduates have intrinsic motivation for *formal academics*? Selection effects dominate again...

Separately, is intrinsic motivation for formal academics valuable? Lmao. I suppose it's more intrinsic motivation for learning that's useful..

But the core question here is that [[If you already like doing something, receiving external rewards decreases intrinsic motivation]]. Why does Alpha not seem to suffer from this, assuming the premise is true?

My hypothesis is that it is because they are very personalized rewards chosen by guides who know the kids well and based on mastery. Plus there is no comparison to others because each child is going at their own pace?
