I'm starting to come around to this idea more and more over time.

The book Existential Kink focuses on the "you" part of this, specifically on the unconscious aspects of yourself. You _want_ to be in some shitty situation. You want to overeat to hide your feelings and so you gain weight so you can feel bad about yourself. You take pleasure in this! Many people fetishize their sadness, and that's normal and OK. Accept that you're doing this and fully take that pleasure! Honestly fetishizing your sadness in some sense means sad -> pleasure, which ultimately ends up in a state where you're not sad? What's wrong with that? Love and embrace it.

I ACTIVELY ENJOY not going outside, ordering very unhealthy food, playing rocket league, watching porn, eating candy, not exercising, on some days!
